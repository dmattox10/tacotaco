# MMMMMM Tacos.
This API will serve up delicious combinations (with config options) of tacos!

### What I learned:
- Traverse directories and build a list
- Read each file from the list in and determine if we want it based on extension, and filename (exclude README files)
- Populate the DB from the list of files we want
